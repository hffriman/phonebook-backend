# phonebook-backend
This is the back-end I made during the course "Full Stack Open 2022" by Open University of Helsinki.
It was made with Node.js and Express. The assignment was partly based on the lecture's instructions as well as my own research, 
both of which were required for all students in order to complete the assignment.
